# Mini TCP Applications

This repository contains two mini TCP applications:

1. **Chat App**: A simple chat application that allows multiple clients to connect to a server and exchange messages.
2. **Uploader App**: A file uploader application that allows clients to upload files to a server in chunks using streams.

Both applications are built using Node.js core modules such as `fs`, `streams`, `events`, `net`, and `process`.
